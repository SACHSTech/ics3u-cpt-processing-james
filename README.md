# Race Invader

space invaders + space race + pro coding for sure!
by james and andy

we introduce, drum rolls "race invader"

this game has it all:
with the nostalgic looks of an arcade game, endless gameplay, a epic shooting 
mechanism, and 2 player mode. 
you can enjoy a nice 1v1 battle with your friends and see who scores the most points!

the game is simple

run code, it starts right away, no need for that useless start-up menu!

1) get across to the top of the map using your navagation keys
- for the first ship use a,w,s,d
- for the second ship use your arrow keys
- if you make it to the top of the screen you can gain 3 point
- keep repeating for more points (no way right?!)

2) dodge obstacles by moving
- just like in space, our game has moving celestial objects (circles)
- if you get collide with these moving objects your will be brought back to the bottom of your screen
- but don't let this reset stop you for getting more points

3) shooting aliens
- randomly spawning aliens will show up, it's your job to deal with em
- don't worry, we've equipped each spaecship with ultra op laser shooting beam things, use these bullets to kill aliens
- bullets will launch out of your ships location and move up, if they collide with alien it breaks
- killing an alien will gain you 1 point, if you kill mutiple aliens nearby, the points u earn are reduced
- you start with 3 ammo, getting to the end of your screen gives you three more ammo.
- aliens don't reset your ship, they can't kill ya

4) game end
- unfortaunely all good things will come to an end, even your game
- once someone reaches 25 points the game will end and that person will be declared the winner
- but don't feel sad, to run the code again all you need to do is click "ENTER," now you can play til your heart's content
- you can click "ESC" to leave program - ): come back to play next time!

for epic gamers who don't like to read
AKA tl;dr dodge moving circles, get to the top for 3 points, and gain 1 point for breaking aliens, play with a friend and see who can gain 25 points first

playing games is always about going above and beyond but remember there is a barrier so that you can't go past the screen to your left and right, so don't worry about losing your ship. making it to the top will reset your location!

Limitations: While our code may seem near perfect at first glance, there are some very minor problems in our game. The first is that The rocket cannnot travel downwards farther than where it started. We did this because it is difficult to control the rocket if it travels outside the screen, and would cause more restarts if you messed up. Another issue that can be seen is that there may only be one bullet on the screen, and spamming the bullets will delete the other bullets that are currently being fired. 

Besides that, we hope you enjoy our game!
